This extension provides a **Join Lines** command for [Nova](https://nova.app/), similar to
the Join Lines command available in VS Code.

The default keyboard shortcut is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>J</kbd>.

Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>J</kbd> will join the current line and the next line. For example, if you have this:

```typescript
console.log(
  "hello world!" );
```

Then, from anywhere on the first line, you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>J</kbd>. Now you have:

```typescript
console.log( "hello world!" );
```

If you don’t want a space to be added at the end of the joined line, there’s a preference for that. It can be found in the Extensions section of your Project Settings.

That’s it!
